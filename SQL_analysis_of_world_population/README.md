# Analysis_of_World_Population
In this project, I analyze the world's population data from a dataset retrieved from Kaggle. 
The dataset comprises of information on world population data from different countries over the period of 1970 to 2022. 



## Questions
* What is the country, capital city, and continent from the "world_population" table?
* What is the number of distinct countries and continents in the "world_population" table?
* What is the average population of each continent in 2022?
* What is the highest and lowest population in 2022?
* What are the countries with the highest and lowest population in 1970?
* What is the population of North America with a capital city called The Valley in the year 2022?
* What are the top 10 populated countries in 2022?
* What are the bottom 10 populated countries in 2022?
* What are the countries whose total population is greater than the average population?
* What is the number of countries whose population is less than the highest population in 2022?
* What is the average population and area of the year 2020?
* What are the most dense populated countries in 2022?
* What are the rank and dense rank of countries' population in the year 2015?
* What is the highest and minimum population growth rate?
* What are the largest and smallest area?
* What is the country with the smallest area?
* What are the country, continent, country code, and area, ordered in descending order based on the new field of area sizes?

## insights found:

* The world population has grown significantly since 1970, with the highest population in 2022 being over 7 billion people. The countries with the highest population in 2022 are China, India, and the United States, respectively.

* Asia has the highest average population among continents, while Oceania has the lowest.

* China and India have the highest population in the world, with over 1 billion people each.

* The Vatican City has the lowest population in the world, with only 510 inhabitants.

* Bangladesh has the highest population density among the countries listed, with over 1,171 people per square kilometer.

* The United States has the highest population among the countries listed in North America, while Brazil has the highest population in South America.

* China has the highest population among the countries listed in Asia, while Nigeria has the highest population in Africa.

* The top ten countries with the highest population in 2022 are led by China and India, followed by the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia, and Mexico.

* China has the highest population density among the countries listed, with over 153 people per square kilometer.

* The area of a country does not necessarily correlate with its population, as some countries with smaller areas (such as Bangladesh and South Korea) have higher populations than larger countries (such as Canada and Russia).
